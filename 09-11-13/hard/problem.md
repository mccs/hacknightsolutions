Using the any programming language, create a function/method called Calculator(str) that takes the  str parameter and evaluates the mathematical expression within the string. For example, if str were "2+(3-1)*3" the output should be 8. Another example: if str were "(2-0)(6/2)" the output should be 6. There can be parenthesis within the string so you must evaluate it properly according to the order of operations. The string will contain the operators: +, -, /, *, (, and ).
